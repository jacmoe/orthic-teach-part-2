* 1
The object of this second manual on the teaching of Orthic Shorthand is to supply fuller explanations, and illustrations, of the methods of abbreviation.
* 2
The “Reporting Style” of Orthic is in no way essentially different from the “Corresponding Style.”

There is little new to learn, and nothing to unlearn. It is simply the same methods of abbreviation as given in the Teacher’s Manual, part I, extended.
* 3
Impress, therefore, upon the students that the abbreviations are no mere arbitraries, but are logical conclusions based upon what has gone before.
* 4
_The Alphabet_. The only additional character is [[file:img/fig1.png]] /b/ - the upright stroke of the longhand character - which may be substituted for [[file:img/fig2.png]], see the combination [[file:img/fig3.png]] /mb/.

This alternative character should only be used medially; as [[file:img/fig4.png]] = /bible/, [[file:img/fig5.png]] /probably/, [[file:img/fig6.png]] equals /but/. Thus [[file:img/fig7.png]] [[file:img/fig8.png]].
* 5
On page 6, paragraph 7, of the Teacher’s Manual, and on page 12 of the Author’s Manual, it has been shown that “ws” final is written with a loop, thus [[file:img/fig9.png]].

By an extension of this principle, we may use the “ws” loop for the _Word was_, and join it to the preceding word. Similarly to “t’was” in longhand; thus [[file:img/fig10.png]] = /I was/, [[file:img/fig11.png]] = /it was/, [[file:img/fig12.png]] /that was/, [[file:img/fig13.png]] /nothing was/, [[file:img/fig14.png]] /if it was/.
* 6
_Supra Linear_. In the termination “vowel ve”, we have the rule laid down, that the omission of this termination may be indicated by a dot, or, if inflected, by the inflection written _above_ the last letter; this was shown to be a logical consequence.

Now this dot, representing the “vowel ve” termination, may very safely be used to indicate _the werb ‘have’_; as [[file:img/fig15.png]] /I have/. Compare /I’ve/ in longhand. [[file:img/fig15-2.png]] /do have/, [[file:img/fig16.png]] /will have/.

N.B. This dot cannot clash with _”be”_. Why? Because this word dot is written _midway between words_; thus /all that can be said we have said/ = [[file:img/fig17.png]].

Naturally following this suggestion, we can deal with “having” in the same way: as [[file:img/fig18.png]] /not having/, cp. [[file:img/fig19.png]] /not being/.
* 7
_Extension of this rule_. This supra linear /ve dot/ may be omitted altogether, and a following word written _in the place of it_, to indicate the verb “have” understood. Thus [[file:img/fig20.png]] /to have been/, [[file:img/fig21.png]] /could have been/, [[file:img/fig22.png]] /he might have had/.
* 8
This /V Mode/ may be extended to the suffix “ow”; thus [[file:img/fig23.png]] /narrower/, [[file:img/fig24.png]] /borrow/, [[file:img/fig25.png]] /borrowing/, [[file:img/fig26.png]] /sorrow/, [[file:img/fig27.png]] /sorrowful/. See Section 32.
* 9
As given in the manual, initial “th” is omitted and the rest of the word written _above_ the line.

Extend this principle, and, by placing _the verb above_ the line, understand the _word they_, omitted. Thus /I think they might have been/ X, cp. /he might have been/ X.
* 10
_Sub linear writing_. As per the Author’s Manual, the prefixes /de/, /di/, and /dis/ may be omitted, and the rest of the word written below the line. Thus X = /declare/, X = /digress/, X /disciple/, X /descend/, X /indisputable/.

Further, when a word begins with “wh”, the “wh” may be omitted, and the rest of the word written _below_ the line. Thus X /who/, X /what/, X /who was/.
* 11
_Extension of this rule_. The word “which” is so frequently in use, that we may safely indicate the omission of the word “which” by writing the following word _below_ the line, as /did you say which it was/ X, /which might have been/ X.

Compare the following positions:
1. X /they might have been/.
2. X /might have been/.
3. X /which might have been/.
* 12
_Intersections_. Many letters in the Orthic alphabet readily intersect. This method may be used to indicate the omission of one or two syllables; and it is especially adapted to the expression of polysyllabic terminations; e.g. /g/ for /logical/, /a/ for /diate/ or /tiate/, etc.
* 13
_Outline cutting outline_. The termination X /ing/ cutting the last part of a word, signifies the omission of “ish”; thus, X = /flourishing/, X = /polishing/, X = /varnishing/.
* 14
The vowel /a/ X will generally intersect another letter, and may be used to express the terminations /tiate/, /diate/, /ate/, and /ade/. As X, /immediate/, or X. X /graduate/, X /fade/.

Inflections of the terminations /ate/ and /ade/ will of course be indicated by the last letter of the inflection; thus X /graduated/, X /actuated/.

Similarly, the vowel /o/ X, may be used to express /ote/ and /ode/; as X /remote/, X /antidote/ or X.
* 15
P, X, is already given in the Manual and Supplement, when intersecting, as equivalent for the termination ‘ship’, thus X /marksmanship/, X /worship/, X /fellowship/, X /secretaryship/.
* 16
G, X, readily intersects, and may be used for the terminations _lough_ and _logical_, e.g. X /catalogue/, X /prologue/, X /zoological/, X /phrenological/.
* 17
S, X, when intersecting the last letter can conveniently stand for any polysyllabic word ending in /ious/, /ceous/, etc. as X /herbaceous/, X /extraneous/, X /expeditious/, etc.
* 18
_Finals_. In abbreviating words ending in /ent/, /ence/, /ency/, /graph/, /ism/, /wise/, use /t/, /ce/, /cy/, /ph/, /m/, and /se/ respectively. Thus, X /subvent/, X /evidence/, X /expediency/, X /telegraph/, X /criticism/, X /otherwise/.
* 19
Y, X, final, _when joined to a preceding letter_, stands for the terminations /ty/, /ary/, or /ory/. Thus, X /duty/, X /beauty/, X /lusty/, X /canary/, X /ordinary/, X /story/, X /conservatory/.

When written _above_ the last letter, and disjoined, it is the equivalent for “ity”, e.g. X /pity/, X /sincerity/.

When written _below_ the last letter it stands for “ly”, as X /truly/, X /verily/, X /daily/.
* 20
/Ou/, X, stands for the terminations /ount/ or /ound/. Thus, X /count/, X /county/, X /profound/, X /astounding/.
* 21
On the principle that X equals /quite/, and X equals /write/, X, /i/, will stand for the terminations “ite” or “ide”. E.g. X /bite/, X /exquisite/, X /confide/, X /deride/, etc.
* 22
By the Manual X is equivalent for “ion”; where, then, the letter ‘u’ precedes ‘tion’ or ‘sion’, the ‘t’ may be slurred, and the ‘u’ lengthened to stand for “ution”, or “usion”. Thus X /diminution/, X /solution/, X /confusion/, X /collusion/.
* 23
The termination “um” and “ium” which occur chiefly in Latin words, may be abbreviated by omitting the ‘u’ and ‘iu’. /Ium/ can be distinguished from ‘um’, when necessary, by dotting the “m”. Thus X /laudanum/, X /sodium/.
* 24
_General abbreviations_. When it is desired to abbreviate words written on the line, and to which the foregoing rules do not apply, it is usually sufficient to write the first part of the word and the termination; to follow the usual longhand contraction, as, /st/ for /first/, /ult/ for /ultimo/, etc. The great secret is to preserve the outline of the most important part of the word, cp. /mtg/ for /mortgage/.

In the Manual X equals /because/, therefore X equals ‘cause’, and may be used for this word.
* 25
Initial /a/ - in words beginning with /anti/, /amphi/, etc. - may be omitted altogether.
* 26
/Y/ X, detached and below, has been given for the termination ‘ly’. If it is found more convenient, in rapid writing, to write the ‘ly’, instead of lifting the pen, it may be done, where it is not likely to be misread. Thus, X for /probably/, X for X /fully/, etc.
* 27
In the common word “right”, the Manual authorises the ‘t’ to be joined to the ‘r’, instead of being written below, as by the rule. This may also be done in such words as /taught/ X, X /daughter/, X /fraught/, X /laughter/, etc.
* 28
X stands for ‘able’, therefore X or X can be taken for the termination /ble/, as X /table/, X /liable/, X /terrible/, X /ignoble/, X /probable/, etc.
* 29
X /ea/ is the recognised contraction for ‘each’, therefore X equals /teach/, X /preach/, X /reaches/, X /preacher/.
* 30
X /ay/ equals ‘any’, therefore X is /accompany/, and X /many/.
* 31
X is /according/, therefore X is /accord/, and by similar reasoning X /record/, X /recording/, etc.
* 32
On page 19 of the Manual Supplement X equals /tomorrow/; to this we add X equals /follow/, the ‘r’ and the ‘l’ respectively being slurred. But for other words, such as /narrow/, /borrow/, /sorrow/, it is better to write X, X, X respectively. See Section 8.
* 33
/U/, X, is the authorised contraction for “under”, whether as a word, prefix, or a part of a word, e.g. X /under/, X /understand/, X /blunder/, X /thunder/.

Extend this rule to the prefixes ‘unde’ and ‘undi’. Thus, X /undetermined/, X /undiminishing/.
* 34
X is the equivalent for /first/, and X for /best/, X for /whilst/.
* 35
X disjoined, stands for the termination /cerning/, as X /concerning/, X /discerning/.
* 36
In reporting the aspirate [sound represented by the letter ‘h’] may invariably be omitted.
* 37
In the Manual an elementary rule is given, in all inflections of /y/ retain the y; where the diphthong /ay/ is inflected, it is not necessary to observe this rule, e.g. /paid/ can be written X or X, X /laid/, etc. The latter form being the easier in rapid writing.
* 38
In the Supplement to the Manual, on page 19, the author says, “there can be no doubt but that the device of shading or thickening a character is _not_ suited for general use.”

Some writers, however, are of opinion that it may be used occasionally, with advantage, in reporting.

The necessary distinction between strokes cannot be accomplished by many individuals; and in rapid reporting the distinction of the strokes, heavy and light, is scarcely apparent.

Moreover the joining of a thin to a thick outline, and vice-versa, is a great difficulty.

The author restricts the use of this device to the adding of the characters ‘l’ and ‘r’; but it appears to me, that it is better, if adopted by any writer, to restrict its use to _single words_, and _terminations standing alone_ and always written downwards.

We therefore adduce [offer as an example] this rule, a thickened _right_ hand stroke, i.e. a character written from left to right, adds ‘r’, _either before or after_, e.g. X is the equivalent for /fr/ /from/, X /rk/ for /work/, X /yr/ /your/, X /are/, etc.

Again, a thickened _left_ hand stroke, adds ‘l’, as X /glad/, X /people/.
