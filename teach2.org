* 1
The object of this second manual on the teaching of Orthic Shorthand is to supply fuller explanations, and illustrations, of the methods of abbreviation.
* 2
The “Reporting Style” of Orthic is in no way essentially different from the “Corresponding Style.”

There is little new to learn, and nothing to unlearn. It is simply the same methods of abbreviation as given in the Teacher’s Manual, part I, extended.
* 3
Impress, therefore, upon the students that the abbreviations are no mere arbitraries, but are logical conclusions based upon what has gone before.
* 4
_The Alphabet_. The only additional character is [[file:img/fig1.png]] /b/ - the upright stroke of the longhand character - which may be substituted for [[file:img/fig2.png]], see the combination [[file:img/fig3.png]] /mb/.

This alternative character should only be used medially; as [[file:img/fig4.png]] = /bible/, [[file:img/fig5.png]] /probably/, [[file:img/fig6.png]] equals /but/. Thus [[file:img/fig7.png]] [[file:img/fig8.png]].
* 5
On page 6, paragraph 7, of the Teacher’s Manual, and on page 12 of the Author’s Manual, it has been shown that “ws” final is written with a loop, thus [[file:img/fig9.png]].

By an extension of this principle, we may use the “ws” loop for the _Word was_, and join it to the preceding word. Similarly to “t’was” in longhand; thus [[file:img/fig10.png]] = /I was/, [[file:img/fig11.png]] = /it was/, [[file:img/fig12.png]] /that was/, [[file:img/fig13.png]] /nothing was/, [[file:img/fig14.png]] /if it was/.
* 6
_Supra Linear_. In the termination “vowel ve”, we have the rule laid down, that the omission of this termination may be indicated by a dot, or, if inflected, by the inflection written _above_ the last letter; this was shown to be a logical consequence.

Now this dot, representing the “vowel ve” termination, may very safely be used to indicate _the werb ‘have’_; as [[file:img/fig15.png]] /I have/. Compare /I’ve/ in longhand. [[file:img/fig15-2.png]] /do have/, [[file:img/fig16.png]] /will have/.

N.B. This dot cannot clash with _”be”_. Why? Because this word dot is written _midway between words_; thus /all that can be said we have said/ = [[file:img/fig17.png]].

Naturally following this suggestion, we can deal with “having” in the same way: as [[file:img/fig18.png]] /not having/, cp. [[file:img/fig19.png]] /not being/.
* 7
_Extension of this rule_. This supra linear /ve dot/ may be omitted altogether, and a following word written _in the place of it_, to indicate the verb “have” understood. Thus [[file:img/fig20.png]] /to have been/, [[file:img/fig21.png]] /could have been/, [[file:img/fig22.png]] /he might have had/.
* 8
This /V Mode/ may be extended to the suffix “ow”; thus [[file:img/fig23.png]] /narrower/, [[file:img/fig24.png]] /borrow/, [[file:img/fig25.png]] /borrowing/, [[file:img/fig26.png]] /sorrow/, [[file:img/fig27.png]] /sorrowful/. See S. 32.
* 9
As given in the manual, initial “th” is omitted and the rest of the word written _above_ the line.

Extend this principle, and, by placing _the verb above_ the line, understand the _word they_, omitted. Thus /I think they might have been/ X, cp. /he might have been/ X.
* 10
_Sub linear writing_. As per the Author’s Manual, the prefixes /de/, /di/, and /dis/ may be omitted, and the rest of the word written below the line. Thus X = /declare/, X = /digress/, X /disciple/, X /descend/, X /indisputable/.

Further, when a word begins with “wh”, the “wh” may be omitted, and the rest of the word written _below_ the line. Thus X /who/, X /what/, X /who was/.
* 11
_Extension of this rule_. The word “which” is so frequently in use, that we may safely indicate the omission of the word “which” by writing the following word _below_ the line, as /did you say which it was/ X, /which might have been/ X.

Compare the following positions:
1. X /they might have been/.
2. X /might have been/.
3. X /which might have been/.
* 12
_Intersections_. Many letters in the Orthic alphabet readily intersect. This method may be used to indicate the omission of one or two syllables; and it is especially adapted to the expression of polysyllabic terminations
